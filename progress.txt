I worked on the events and Historical pages for the tourism site, as well as a map with pins for local restraunts, bars, theme parks, historical sites, sports, music venus, frestival events. I also have been fiddling around with the base page layout and getting the pages to expand and retract properly.


week 10 dat 5 : I worked mainly on the style of the events page was unable to work on the project for as long as I wanted made a little progress.
