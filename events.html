        <h3>The Festival of Lights</h3>
        <p>Beginning Nov. 19, the Cincinnati Zoo will be transformed into a “Wild Wonderland” for the 39th annual festival. Four million LED lights will adorn the zoo grounds – a festival often named among the best light shows in the nation. In addition to marveling at the lights, visitors can ride the North Polar Express train ride, admire the spectacular Wild Lights show on Swan Lake, or snack at one of two S’mores-n-More stands. The festival began 39 years ago as a way for the zoo to increase visitors during the winter months. Early displays consisted of luminarias and some seasonal lighting, and that light display has grown each year. Now, it takes more than 5,000 hours to install the 3 million lightbulbs across the zoo’s grounds. Decorating begins yearly in August. Zoo officials say their lights stretch 284 miles – or the distance from Cincinnati to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The zoo’s famed rainbow tunnel, alone, has just over a mile and a half of lights.</p>
